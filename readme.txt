today is the first day to learn git.
now I just learn about git add and commit command
The next step is continue to learn git and konw more command
THE next command I learned is git diff [file] to look what I have changed to this file
I learned git reset --hard [ban ben hao] to move back to the old file, and git reflog to show the command I had write, and I kown HEAD is the present,HEAD^ is the last,use HEAD~(numbers) to back the last specify version
